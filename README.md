### Authentication & Authorization Example

Clone this repo for an example of how to set up a simple User resource with bcrypt and use a SessionsController to handle authorization of users across the app.

For a much more indepth example of how to construct and use authentication & authorization functionality in a Rails 4 app check out Michael Hartl's incredible *Ruby on Rails Tutorial*, [chapter 7](http://www.railstutorial.org/book/sign_up) and [chapter 8](http://www.railstutorial.org/book/sign_in_out).
